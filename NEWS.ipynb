(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi) Split into rival power centres, its medical infrastructure shattered by war and seen by the United Nations as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, Yemen is handicapped by its own destitution in its fight against the new coronavirus. (AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)\\n\\nWhen doctors first confirmed Yemeni port official Saleh had contracted COVID-19, authorities raced to trace his movements to try and protect one of the world’s most vulnerable countries.\\n\\nBut almost three weeks on, they still do not know whether Yemen’s first laboratory-confirmed case is really the individual at the root of what could be an unusually devastating outbreak.\\n\\nThe information gap reflects Yemen’s inability to detect, let alone repel, an infection humbling far wealthier nations.\\n\\nSplit into rival power centres, its medical infrastructure shattered by war and seen by the United Nations as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, Yemen is handicapped by its own destitution in its fight against the new coronavirus.\\n\\nAltaf Musani, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Yemen mission, said transmission of the disease in Yemen could be in what he called a phase of “individual cases”, a possible prelude to clusters of infection.\\n\\nBut it is proving impossible to identify so-called “patient zero”, an important step in tracking and tracing all those potentially exposed to infection and containing an outbreak.\\n\\nSaleh, a heavy smoker with heart problems whose condition has been described as stable, was tested on April 7 at a medical facility in the southern Ash Shihr port after showing symptoms. On April 10 he was tested again: Positive on both occasions.\\n\\nHealth officials then scrambled to identify more than 150 people in the southern Hadhramout region who had met and dealt with the 60-year-old in the two weeks before he was diagnosed, the head of the national coronavirus committee said.\\n\\n“All the close contacts were monitored and some showed some symptoms but were negative when they were tested,” Ali al-Walidi told Reuters. Instead, their coughs and fever were normal flu.\\n\\nSome 20 people including Saleh’s family who were in close contact with him were ordered to self-isolate for two weeks.\\n\\nAuthorities concluded they could not say if Saleh, whose full name is withheld due to privacy reasons, was Yemen’s first spreader of the infection due to inadequate testing capacity.\\n\\n“We spent an hour-and-a-half with him in the ambulance to transfer him to an isolation room in another hospital, it felt like a year-and-a half,” said nurse Majdi Baqhoum, worried to be dealing with a COVID-19 patient for the first time.\\n\\nAsh Shihr port was shut for deep cleaning for a week and Hadhramout, Yemen’s largest province, imposed a partial curfew and all its workers were ordered to self-isolate for two weeks. Neighbouring provinces sealed their borders.\\n\\n“WE WILL KEEP INVESTIGATING”\\n\\nAid groups say they fear a catastrophic outbreak should the virus spread among the malnourished population, where diseases such as cholera are rife. Around 80% of the population, or 24 million people, rely on humanitarian assistance.\\n\\nBased on models by Britain’s Imperial College, the World Health Organisation said a likely outbreak scenario with containment steps could see more than 55% of the population infected, with over 42,000 dying from the disease.\\n\\nWHO’s Musani said Yemen has 570 intensive care units and 17,000 beds nationwide, half of them already occupied. “At the height of coronavirus infections in Yemen, the country could need 18,000 beds and 2,500 ICU units for COVID-19 only, so you can imagine the gap,” he said.\\n\\nClues to how Saleh became infected exist.\\n\\nAs part of his job at Ash Shihr, Saleh had met and dealt with government and military officials and traders on dozens of the wooden dhows that dock each day with commercial goods, mostly from Oman and the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\nHadhramout Governor Faraj al-Bahsseni told local media, there was a high probability he contracted the virus from sailors who visited the port.\\n\\nBut authorities also note Saleh also visited three different districts inland in Hadhramout during the two weeks that preceded his persistent coughing fits, officials said.\\n\\n“It is still a mystery to us how he contracted the virus. We will keep investigating, but we may never know,” Bahsseni told local media.\\n\\nYemen has been mired in war and more than 100,000 people have been killed since the Iran-aligned Houthi group ousted the internationally recognised government from the capital Sanaa in late 2014, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene.\\n\\nThe coalition announced a unilateral nationwide truce over the pandemic but the Houthis, who control most big urban centres, have not accepted it and violence has continued.\\n\\nTwo sources familiar with the matter told Reuters there has been at least one confirmed case in the capital Sanaa. But the Houthi-controlled health ministry denied it and said all suspected cases had tested negative for COVID-19.\\n\\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

(Source: Getty/Thinkstock)\\n\\nA four-year-old Indian toddler in Dubai, despite her low immune system, has become one of the youngest coronavirus survivors in the UAE after she recovered from the deadly disease last week, according to a media report.\\n\\nSivani, who is also a cancer survivor, was admitted on April 1 at the Al Futtaim Health Hub after she got infected with the virus passed on by her mother who is a frontline health worker, the Gulf News reported. Both Sivani and her dad were also tested despite not having any symptoms and, unlike her father, Sivani was found to be positive, the report said.\\n\\nSivani and her mother were kept in the same facility, but extra precautions were made for the girl who had also fought off a rare type of kidney cancer last year called ganglioneuroblastoma. Sivani was discharged from the hospital on April 20, the report said.\\n\\n“Sivani had undergone chemotherapy sessions only last year and hence her immune system was still weak”, said Dr. Tholfkar Al Baaj, group medical director at Al Futtaim Health Hub and the consultant in family medicine who treated Sivani. “The doctors were concerned as she was at higher risk of developing a severe form of the disease and therefore, we had put her under close monitoring. Fortunately, she did not develop any complications from the infection”, he added.\\n\\nSivani remained under treatment for 20 days before two consecutive negative swab tests rendered her all clear. She will now undergo 14-days quarantine at home, the report added. Sivani’s mother has also completed her treatment but remains under observation and is expected to be released soon.\\n\\nSivani is believed to be one of the youngest coronavirus recoveries in the UAE. Others were a seven-year-old Syrian girl and a nine-year-old Filipino boy both in Abu Dhabi, the report added.\\n\\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

It also added that the above symptoms ‘may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus’.\\n\\n“People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported — ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness,” the CDC website reads. It also added the emergency warning signs that need immediate medical attention. These include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face.\\n\\nHowever, it added that the list is not all inclusive and one still needs to consult their medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.\\n\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. “Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhea,” read the WHO website.\\n\\n“These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms,” it added.\\n\\nThe WHO also warned that “around one out of every 5 people who get COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing”.\\n\\n“Anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill. Even people with very mild symptoms of COVID-19 can transmit the virus. People of all ages who experience fever, cough, and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention,” the WHO said.\\n\\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The United States continued to be the worst affected, with over 960,000 cases and over 52,000 deaths.\\n\\nAfter the US, Spain reported 226,629 infections followed by Italy (197,675), France (162,220), Germany (157,770), the United Kingdom (154,037) and Turkey (110,130). No fresh deaths were reported from mainland China, the country’s health ministry said Monday.\\n\\nHere is a look at some of the top global developments:\\n\\nUN raises alarm about police brutality in lockdowns\\n\\nThe U.N. human rights office voiced concern on Monday about more than a dozen countries that have declared states of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic where police have arrested or detained hundreds of thousands of people and killed others. “Emergency powers should not be a weapon governments can wield to quash dissent, control the population, and even perpetuate their time in power,” U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in a statement that denounced shootings and detentions without being specific.\\n\\nA top official from her office said about 80 countries have declared emergencies due to the new coronavirus, including 15 where the allegations were deemed most troubling. They were: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Peru, Honduras, Jordan, Morocco, Cambodia, Uzbekistan, Iran and Hungary.\\n\\nHowever, Georgette Gagnon, director of field operations, added at a virtual briefing in Geneva “there are probably several dozen more we could have highlighted”.” A main concern on exceptional emergency measures is what has been described as a toxic lockdown culture in some countries,” Gagnon said.\\n\\nWar-hit Yemen struggles to trace COVID-19 infection\\n\\nWhen doctors first confirmed Yemeni port official Saleh had contracted COVID-19, authorities raced to trace his movements to try and protect one of the world’s most vulnerable countries. But almost three weeks on, they still do not know whether Yemen’s first laboratory-confirmed case is really the individual at the root of what could be an unusually devastating outbreak.\\n\\nThe information gap reflects Yemen’s inability to detect, let alone repel, an infection humbling far wealthier nations. Split into rival power centres, its medical infrastructure shattered by war and seen by the United Nations as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, Yemen is handicapped by its own destitution in its fight against the new coronavirus.\\n\\nAltaf Musani, the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Yemen mission, said transmission of the disease in Yemen could be in what he called a phase of “individual cases”, a possible prelude to clusters of infection. But it is proving impossible to identify so-called “patient zero”, an important step in tracking and tracing all those potentially exposed to infection and containing an outbreak.\\n\\nCDC adds six new symptoms\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has added six new possible symptoms for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. Previously, the US’ top health body had declared fever, cough, and shortness of breath as the symptoms.\\n\\nThe new possible symptoms, as updated by the CDC, include chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell. Shortness of breath has also been updated to ‘shortness of breath or difficulty breathing’. The full list now includes fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell.\\n\\nThe CDC also added that a runny nose rarely happens with COVID-19 and that sneezing is still not a symptom of the virus infection. It also added that the above symptoms ‘may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus’.\\n\\nUK stock markets jump on signs of coronavirus cases easing\\n\\nLondon-listed shares joined a global rally on Monday as signs of an easing in the coronavirus outbreak raised hopes a month-long lockdown was working, while diagnostics firm Novacyt surged on news of a supply contract with the UK government. The clinical diagnostics company jumped 12.8% after saying it would supply its coronavirus testing kits to the UK’s Department of Health and Social Care for an initial period of six months starting next week.\\n\\nThe domestically focussed midcap index rose 2.3%, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street almost a month after he was diagnosed with COVID-19. An earlier report said Johnson could announce a plan to ease the lockdown as early as this week, but on Monday he warned it was still too dangerous for fear of a deadly second outbreak. The government is next due to review social distancing measures on May 7.\\n\\nAfter Covid-19 recovery, Johnson prepares for lockdown exit\\n\\nConfirmed coronavirus cases in the UK stand at 152,840. (File) Confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK stand at 152,840. (File)\\n\\nWith British Prime Minister Boris Johnson returning home after recovering from Covid-19 Sunday, his first challenge will be unveiling a plan to ease the ongoing lockdown. Johnson has been urged to reveal the lockdown exit strategy after Foreign minister Dominic Raab announced that the lockdown and social distancing measures would be extended for another three weeks and would last at least till 3 May.\\n\\nThe official number of deaths related to COVID-19 in hospitals across the United Kingdom rose to 20,732, up by 413 in 24 hours, while confirmed cases stood at 152,840, up by 4,463.\\n\\nRead| Bill Gates’s coronavirus vaccine could be ready in 12 months\\n\\nItaly to partially lift lockdown from May 4\\n\\nItaly is preparing to lift Europe’s longest coronavirus lockdown by allowing factories and building sites to reopen from May 4, besides permitting limited family visits, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Sunday. The country is planning to reopen the economy without triggering a new wave of coronavirus infections.\\n\\n“We expect a very complex challenge,” Conte said as he outlined the road map to restarting activities put into hibernation since early March. “We will live with the virus and we will have to adopt every precaution possible,” he added.\\n\\nRead| Coronavirus forcing countries to reevaluate security paradigms\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington.

(AP Photo/Hani Mohammed, File)\\n\\nThe head of World Food Program David Beasley warned the UN Security Council last week that as the world deals with the COVID-19 pandemic it is “on the brink of a hunger pandemic” that could lead to “multiple famines of biblical proportions” within a few months if immediate action isn’t taken.\\n\\nBeasley said he has been on the phone with leaders of some of the world’s richest nations with a critical message: the coronavirus pandemic is not only affecting your economy but is impacting the economies of vulnerable and conflict-torn countries where millions of people will face starvation if you cut the UN agency’s funding for food. “If we have money and access we can avert famine and we can truly avert catastrophic humanitarian death from starvation,but if we lose our funding, or we lose supply chain, there’s going to be disaster.” he added.\\n\\nWFP is providing food to nearly 100 million people on any given day, including “about 30 million people who literally depend on us to stay alive,” Beasley said. And if those 30 million people can’t be reached, “our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period” and that doesn’t include increased starvation due to the new coronavirus.\\n\\n“In a worst-case scenario, we could be looking at famine in about three dozen countries,” and in 10 of them there are already more than 1 million people per country on the verge of starvation.\\n\\nFrance Covid-19 deaths cross 22,000 as govt seeks to ease lockdown\\n\\nThe first coronavirus case in France(also in Europe) was confirmed on 24 January in Southwestern part of the country.

While the number of deaths from the virus has risen, the rate at which the casualties have mounted has steadily fallen over the last two weeks, emboldening those who want France to start to lift the lockdown measures.\\n\\nSouth Korea could announce reopening of schools\\n\\nSouth Korean Prime Minister, Chung Syekyun instructed education officials to prepare hygiene and social distancing measures so the government could announce a timeline for reopening schools no later than early May.

(AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)\\n\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said he was “confident” he will be able to annex large parts of the occupied West Bank this summer, with support from the US.\\n\\nSpeaking to an online gathering of evangelical Christian supporters of Israel, Netanyahu said President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan envisions turning over Israel’s dozens of settlements, as well as the strategic Jordan Valley, to Israeli control.\\n\\n“A couple of months from now, I’m confident that that pledge will be honored, that we will be able to celebrate another historic moment in the history of Zionism,” Netanyahu said.\\n\\nIsraeli annexation of West Bank territory would be highly controversial, drawing widespread international condemnations and extinguishing any lingering hopes of establishing a viable independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.\\n\\nThe Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek the entire West Bank as part of an independent state. They have already threatened to cancel existing peace agreements if Netanyahu moves forward with his plan, while the European Union foreign policy chief said annexation would be a violation of international law and force the bloc to “act accordingly.”\\n\\nThe UN’s Mideast envoy said such a step would “ignite” the region. But Netanyahu and his hard-line base are eager to move ahead while Trump remains in office. Annexation would be popular with Trump’s evangelical base as he seeks to shore up support ahead of a difficult re-election battle.\\n\\nIn Washington, a US official said the American position hasn’t changed. The official said the US is “prepared to recognize Israeli actions to extend Israeli sovereignty” in parts of the West Bank, and that the US is consulting closely with Israel on the timing and scope of those actions.\\n\\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. Netanyahu last week reached a power-sharing deal with his main rival, Benny Gantz.\\n\\nAlthough Gantz, a former Israeli military chief, has given only lukewarm support for West Bank annexation, their coalition agreement allows Netanyahu to present the plan to his Cabinet and to parliament for fast-track approval.\\n\\nIsrael captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and its settlements are now home to some 500,000 Israelis, in addition to over 200,000 Israelis living in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. After Trump unveiled his Mideast plan in January, Netanyahu pledged to begin annexing territory immediately.\\n\\nBut the Trump administration quickly delayed the plan, and the sides set up a joint committee to formulate a plan together. Netanyahu addressed a conference marking the 100th anniversary of the San Remo Conference, a post-World War I gathering in Italy that helped lay the foundations for Israel’s establishment in 1948.\\n\\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

       " {'text': 'In this April 22, 2020, file photo President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/File) In this April 22, 2020, file photo President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/File)\\n\\nAfter two months of frantic response to the coronavirus, the White House is planning to shift President Donald Trump’s public focus to the burgeoning efforts aimed at easing the economic devastation caused by the pandemic.\\n\\nDays after he publicly mused that scientists should explore the injection of toxic disinfectants as a potential virus cure, Trump has now rejected the utility of his daily task force briefings where he has time and again clashed with scientific experts. Trumps aides are aiming to move the president onto more familiar _ and safer they hope _ ground: talking up the economy in tighter controlled settings.\\n\\nIt’s a political imperative as allies have seen an erosion in support for the president. What had been his greatest asset in the reelection campaign his ability to blanket news headlines with freewheeling performances has become a daily liability. At the same time new Republican Party polling shows Trump’s path to a second term depends on the public’s perception of how quickly the economy rebounds from the state-by-state shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the virus.\\n\\nSome states have started to ease closure orders and Trump is expected to begin to highlight his administrations work in helping businesses and employees. Aides said the president would hold more frequent roundtables with CEOs business owners and beneficiaries of the trillions of dollars in federal aid already approved by Congress and begin to outline what he hopes to see in a future recovery package.\\n\\nTrump last left the White House grounds a month ago and plans are being drawn up for a limited schedule of travel within the next few weeks aide said. It would be a symbolic show that the nation is beginning to reopen.\\n\\nThe shift comes in conjunction with what the White House sees as encouraging signs across the country with the pace of new infections stabilizing and deaths declining.\\n\\nStill, medical experts warn that the virus will remain until at least a vaccine is developed and that the risk of a severe second wave is high if social distancing is relaxed too quickly or if testing and contact tracing schemes aren’t developed before people return to normal behaviors.\\n\\nThe White House is deliberating whether to continue to hold news briefings in a modified form without Trump potentially at a different location. Before Trump said in a tweet Saturday that they were “Not worth the time effort,” aides had been eager to use the briefings to highlight positive trends and to overwhelm Americans with statistics. It was an effort to restore confidence in the response so that the public would be comfortable resuming more normal activities.\\n\\n“We know that’s important” Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” “We understand those messages of science and policy need to be brought forward to the American people in a nonpolitical way.”\\n\\nFew Americans regularly look to or trust Trump as a source of information on the pandemic, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released last week\\n\\nOn Monday, the White House was expected to release a recap of what the federal government has done so far to improve the availability of COVID-19 testing, personal protective equipment and ventilators\\n\\nStill, governors in both parties say much more is needed, particularly in testing, in the coming months, as they deliberate how and when to reopen their states\\n\\n“I want to get our economy back opened just as soon as we can but I want to do so in a safe way so we dont have a spike, we don’t cause more deaths, or an overloading of our health care system,” Gov Larry Hogan, RMd told ABC’s “This Week.”\\n\\nBirx expressed frustration that Trump’s injection comments were still in the headlines, illustrating the tensions that have emerged between the president and his medical advisers.\\n\\n“As a scientist and a public health official and a researcher sometimes I worry that we dont get the information to the American people that they need, when we continue to bring up something that was from Thursday night,” she said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\\n\\nAs the White House hopes it has turned a corner, it is also beginning to assess responsibility for critical missteps. Two senior administration officials said Trump has begun discussions about replacing Health and Human Services. Secretary Alex Azar, who led the coronavirus task force during its initial weeks and has been blamed for a culture of bureaucratic infighting during that period. Azar has been largely sidelined since Vice President Mike Pence took charge of the task force in late February.\\n\\nTrump on Sunday denied that he was going to fire Azar in a tweet, saying “Alex is doing an excellent job!”\\n\\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Bill Gates, the world’s second-richest man, said vaccine production will probably not start in September, as some have said.\\n\\nBillionaire Bill Gates is funding production of the seven most promising ideas for a vaccine as he refocuses his philanthropic work on the deadly coronavirus.\\n\\n“If everything went perfectly, we’d be in scale manufacturing within a year,” Gates said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” “It could be as long as two years.”\\n\\nThe world’s second-richest man said vaccine production will probably not start in September, as some have said.\\n\\n“Dr. Fauci and I have been fairly consistent to say 18 months to create expectations that are not too high,” Gates said, referring to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force.\\n\\nThe availability of testing for the coronavirus has been a sore spot in the U.S. for months. President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that the U.S. “just passed 5 million Tests, far more than any other country.”\\n\\nJust looking at raw numbers misses the true picture, Gates said.\\n\\n“This focus on the number of tests understates the cacophony and the mistakes we’ve made in the testing system,” Gates said. “The wrong people are being tested, and any time you don’t get results in less than 24 hours, the value of the test is dramatically reduced.”\\n\\nThe philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft Corp. said his best-case scenario for a phased reopening of the economy is to “pick the high-value activities like school, manufacturing and construction, and figure out a way to do those with masks and distancing.”\\n\\nSchools\\n\\n“If we can figure out how to do K-through-12 in the fall, that would be good,” Gates said, adding that the U.S. may even be able to open colleges “if we’re creative about it.”\\n\\n“It will probably be in August where we know what’s the protocol, how many schools are opening up, and we won’t really know enough until pretty close to the start,” he said.\\n\\nGates also warned that trying to rush a reopening and generating “exponential” growth in Covid-19 cases “will be seeding other parts of the country,” comparing it to the infection spreading via international travel in early 2020.\\n\\nMicrosoft shares, at around $174, are up about 10% for the year to date, even though major market indexes are down and some companies’ stocks have been hammered.\\n\\n“Tech companies in some ways benefit from an acceleration of a move towards digital approaches, even though the next few years they’ll have a lot of customers that they’ll be helping out, giving free licenses to, where things won’t be as strong,” Gates said.\\n\\nEarlier, in an interview with the Financial Times, Gates said that his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with an endowment exceeding $40 billion, will give “total attention” to Covid-19.\\n\\nThe foundation has contributed $250 million to help counter the coronavirus so far, and is re-purposing units dedicated to fighting other diseases to join in the battle against the pandemic.\\n\\nGates defended the World Health Organization against accusations from Trump that the body had mishandled the virus response.\\n\\n“WHO is clearly very, very important and should actually get extra support to perform their role during this epidemic,” he told the FT.\\n\\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

(Getty Images) Trump on Wednesday had suggested the possibility of studying injecting disinfectants into COVID-19 patients or bringing UV light “inside” their bodies to kill the deadly virus. (Getty Images)\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump’s remarks that disinfectants could potentially treat coronavirus patients remaining in the news after four days of them being made was “bothering”, a key member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus has said.\\n\\n“I think it bothers me that this is still in the news cycle, because I think we’re missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing, as American people, to continue to protect one another,” Dr Deborah Brix, member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus, told CNN in an interview.\\n\\nTrump on Wednesday had suggested the possibility of studying injecting disinfectants into COVID-19 patients or bringing UV light “inside” their bodies to kill the deadly virus, drawing immediate flak from health experts while a leading disinfectant producer urged people not to listen to such dangerous speculation.\\n\\nBrix, a leading doctor specialising in HIV/AIDS immunology, said the dialogue should focus on asymptomatic cases and not on the president’s remarks.\\n\\n“We should be having that dialogue about this unique clotting that we’re seeing. We are the first country that really had young people to this degree. Italy and Europe is about eight years older than us, as a median age.\\n\\n“So, this is the first experience of this virus in an open society, where we really can understand what’s happening to every different age group. These are the things that we should be talking about and focusing on,” Brix said.\\n\\n“As a scientist and a public health official and a researcher, sometimes, I worry that we don’t get the information to the American people that they need, when we continue to bring up something that was from Thursday night,” she said.\\n\\nResponding to a question, Brix said Trump made it clear that physicians must study his idea.\\n\\n“I think I have made it clear that this was a musing. But I want us to move on to be able to get information to the American people that can help them protect each other and also help them understand how devastating this virus is to different age groups and different symptoms and different comorbidities,? she said.\\n\\nDr Brix said that she is “always concerned” when asked about a potential surge in new cases and deaths after many states have started taking actions to open up their economy.\\n\\n“I’m always concerned. And that’s why we put out key, key gating criteria. And that gating criteria was not only looking at the epidemic. It was looking at the health care workers and making sure that the health care workers were protected. And it was also looking at capacity within the hospitals,” she said.\\n\\nNoting that over the last few weeks there is a better understand how much asymptomatic cases and asymptomatic spread may be out there, Dr Brix underscored the need for sentinel surveillance, monitoring proactively in long-term care facilities, in inner-city clinics that have multi-generational households, in prisons, among Native Americans, to really ensure to find the virus before people even get symptoms.\\n\\n“And that’s a key part of this also that, sometimes, I think is missing when we’re talking about diagnosis and contact tracing. We also have to diagnose the virus before it is evident in communities,” she said.\\n\\nThe coronavirus, which originated in China’s Wuhan city, has claimed over 2,00,000 lives and infected nearly 3 million people in the world so far. There are nearly a million confirmed coronavirus cases with over 54,000 deaths in the US.\\n\\n📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
